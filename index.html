                <strong>Late 1940s</strong> - With the little money from his Western 
                    Union job delivering telegrams, he'd ride the fare from Fifth Avenue and

                    <a class="milton-link" href="https://youtu.be/rQLBitV69Cc">Milton Friedman.</a> It was in Professior Friendman's price
                    theory class in which he read Friedrich von Hayek’s essay 
                    <a class="knowledge-link" href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">
                        “The Use of Knowledge in Society.”
                    </a>This left an impact on how fragmented data and knowledge is decentralized  amongst
                    people and how this shaped decision making for the free market system.

            <li>
                <strong>1960</strong> - It was during his internship at the US Department of Labor, Sowell's faith in the 
                role of government and government programs changed. This was also the time his views on Marxism fiercely changed.
                He was assigned to study the impacts of the historical US minimum wage laws in the sugar 
                 cane industry of Puerto Rico. At the time there was a rise in the unemployment rates and declining sugar cane 
                  production. Leading experts speculated this was due to hurricanes.

                        “I came into the office one day, and I announced to the whole group: ‘What we need are statistics on the 
                        amount of sugarcane standing in the fields before the hurricane came through,’” Sowell recalled. “I am
                        waiting for the congratulations and I could see looks of shock in the room: ‘This idiot has stumbled on
                        something that could ruin us all.’ I was concerned whether this law was beneficial or not beneficial
                        to low-income people. They were concerned because this law was providing one-third of the income of 
                        the US Department of Labor.”
